### Editing your Default Facebook Metadata:

1. Hover over the "SEO" plugin link in the admin menu and click on "Social"
2. Configure your info as necessary here. You have options for Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ as well
3. That's all you'll need to do to setup your default Facebook settings. When a page doesn't have an image it will use that image you enter in this screen. For now I set it to your GitHub avatar. 

### Edit your Main Pages or Portfolio Google and Social Settings:


1. Visit any of your "Pages" or "Portfolio" pages in edit mode. For this screenshot I'm editing your Home Page. Once you're in the edit page scroll down to the "WordPress SEO by Yoast" Metabox.
2. Enter in settings for your page to look pretty smooth on Google. You can give it a keyword, a clean title and also a meta description that will tell you when you get cut off by Google (127 characters I believe).
3. Once you're done with step 2 click on the "Social" tab just above all the fields
4. Enter in custom Social data if necessary. This will override the data you setup for Google Search. Sometimes it comes in handy if you want to add a specific image sized to look good on Facebook timelines as well as Google+. Or if you just want to give it a different description.
