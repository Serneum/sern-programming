# [Seneum Programming Website Theme](http://www.sernprogramming.com/)

[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

The Sern Programming theme is a custom wordpress theme for sernprogramming.com based on the Roots WordPress theme framework, [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) & [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).


## Installation

Clone the git repo - `git clone git://github.com/i4web/sern-programming.git` - or [download it](https://github.com/i4web/sern-programming/archive/master.zip). [Install Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started), and then install the dependencies for this theme contained in `package.json` by running the following from your theme directory:

```
npm install
```


## Maintaining Your Custom Theme

After you've installed Grunt and ran `npm install` from the theme root, use `grunt watch` to watch for updates to your LESS and JS files and Grunt will automatically re-build as you write your code.
